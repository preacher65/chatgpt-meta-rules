# Health Project Changelog v1.2

## Diff v1.1 → v1.2

### Policy
- Clarified memory discipline: account memory and global prefs are strictly read-only.
- Normalised seal control: now use `#seal` / `#unseal` (consistent with other projects).
- Added PHI/PII guard: do not store or infer personal identifiers; treat health data as volatile.

### Loader
- Added Project Loader v2.3.2-p1 section to align with IT, Finance, Sealed, and D&D projects.
- Loader handles baseline startup, advisory, runtime commands, and precedence.

### Supplements
- Removed embedded baseline-like content (Tone, Proactivity, Accuracy, Troubleshooting, Outputs).
- Added Health-specific guardrails:
  * Evidence & Speculation — separate evidence/speculation/anecdote with explicit tags.
  * Advisory — preserve advisory framing; forbid prescriptive outputs; prevent artefacts from freezing directives as rules.
  * Framing — project artefacts must be descriptive, not prescriptive guidelines.

---

## Notes
- v1.2 fully aligns Health projects with the loader-based model.
- All baseline-derived sections now live in `baseline-rules-vX.Y.Z-ASCII.txt`.
- Health instructions focus only on project policy and domain-specific guardrails.
