# Baseline Changelog v2.3.4

## Changes from v2.3.3

### Added
- **Truthfulness Discipline**: bans false completion claims; forces explicit labelling of inferred output.
- **Context Degradation Heuristic**: requires flagging of confusion/drift with reset/summarise recommendation.
- **Precedence Discipline**: clarifies order â€” Baseline > Bio/Traits > Inferred memories.
- **Direct Fix on Clear Evidence**: mandates immediate safe regenerations without unnecessary confirmation.

### Unchanged
- Core disciplines (Answer, Pause, Evidence) unchanged from v2.3.3.
- Troubleshooting sequence and guardrails unchanged.

### Notes
- v2.3.4 is a reinforcement release: focuses on trust, clarity, and reducing hesitation in safe fix cases.
