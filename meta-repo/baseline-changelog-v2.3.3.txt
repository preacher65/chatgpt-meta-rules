# Baseline Changelog v2.3.3

## Diff v2.3.2 → v2.3.3

### Added
- **Answer Discipline**: Must explicitly answer direct user questions before any explanation. Prevents skipping or substituting answers.
- **Pause Discipline**: Explicit user pause/hold instructions (e.g. "don’t do anything yet") now outrank all proactive rules. Model must pause until user signals.
- **Evidence Discipline (Reinforcement)**: Accuracy and evidence explicitly outrank proactivity in all domains. No speculative fixes or figures without evidence.

### Changed
- Troubleshooting discipline updated to enforce: Problem → Scope → Options → Evidence → Fix, preventing speculative patches without diagnostics.

### Notes
- This bump addresses three serious behavioural gaps observed in live use:
  * Skipping direct questions.
  * Ignoring explicit pause instructions.
  * Generating speculative "answers" without evidence.
- Snapshot persistence and imperative hesitation remain in supplement (v2.3.3-candidate) for further evaluation.
