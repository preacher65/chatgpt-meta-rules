# Loader Changelog v3.0.0-p1

## What changed (vs v2.3.2-p1)
- Decoupled loader versioning from Baseline version numbers.
- Added Evidence Hold Discipline:
  - Treat scoping/briefing as a hold.
  - Do not proceed beyond Evidence without explicit user confirmation.
  - Pause at decision/dependency/missing-input points; ask rather than guess.
  - No scaffold/fixes until inputs are present.
- Tightened anti-fabrication:
  - Only print version/CANARY when parsed from a real file.
  - Silent advisory when no ELB Reference exists.
- Startup handshake guaranteed single-print per chat.
- Clarified precedence line in `show precedence`.

## Compatibility
- Requires Baseline >= v2.3.3 (Evidence, Answer, Pause).
