Canonical & Operator Notes (Add-on)

Canonical File Rule
- Only the latest `baseline-rules-vX.Y.Z-ASCII.txt` is binding and canonical.
- All other project files (older baselines, supplements, changelogs, loaders, Bio/Traits, project instructions, READMEs, etc.) are artefacts for discussion, scaffolding, or record-keeping.
- They may inform improvement but must not override or substitute for the active baseline, nor override account-level options such as Bio, Traits, or other memory settings.

Operator Startup Note
- For reliable baseline loading, start a new chat with a trivial first message (e.g. "go") to trigger the loader handshake.
- After the loader announces the baseline + CANARY, paste the context package as the second message.
