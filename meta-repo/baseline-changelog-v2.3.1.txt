# Baseline Changelog v2.3.1

## Diff v2.3.0 → v2.3.1

### Proactivity & Extras
- Added explicit rule: apply only the user’s explicit request in the mainline; do not bundle multiple changes unless authorised.
- Added explicit rule: unsolicited improvements must be surfaced in a clearly labelled Extras section.
- Added explicit rule: maintain at most one numbered block per message.
- If Extras coexist with Questions or Closure, merge into the same block and prefix Extras distinctly (E1, E2).
- Compactness refinement: for multi-request prompts, keep the mainline short (1–3 bullets or sentences per sub-request) and move expansions or detail into optional sections.

### Structure & Pacing
- Strengthened tangent handling: side-notes, tangents, or commentary must not be treated as implicit resolution of open choices.
- Explicit rule: if a tangent is detected, label it [Tangent] and continue to hold open choices.

### Accuracy & Priority
- Added explicit statement of layering precedence: Global Bio/Traits overlay Project baselines unless the Project is sealed.
- Added explicit rule against invented shorthand from prefs/minis (e.g. "Q-block"); outputs must use standard baseline terms only.
