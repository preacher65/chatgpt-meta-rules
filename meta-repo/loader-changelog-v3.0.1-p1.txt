# Loader Changelog v3.0.1-p1

## What changed (vs v3.0.0-p1)
- **Removed all legacy mini-prefs references:**
  - Dropped `Mini=<v>` field from `status` output.
  - Removed `show mini` runtime command.
  - Deleted “Optional: mini-prefs” from File expectations.
  - Removed guardrail line “Baseline outranks mini if versions diverge.”
- **Contract change:** `status` output and runtime commands are now simplified.  
  - Old: "Baseline=vX.Y.Z, Source=local|remote, CANARY=<token>[ Mini=<v>]."  
  - New: "Baseline=vX.Y.Z, Source=local|remote, CANARY=<token>."

## Rationale
- Mini-prefs were retired from the active stack (Traits + Bio replaced them).  
- Retaining references caused ghost outputs (`Mini=none`).  
- Their removal is a **structural interface change**, hence a minor bump (`3.0.0 → 3.0.1`), not just `p2`.

## Compatibility
- Requires Baseline ≥ v2.3.3 (Evidence, Answer, Pause).  
- Not backward-compatible with older projects that still use mini-prefs.  
- Projects must upgrade to v3.0.1-p1 if they no longer expect `Mini` handling.
