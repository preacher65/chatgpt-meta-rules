# Loader Changelog v3.0.1-p2

## What changed (vs v3.0.1-p1)
- **Evidence Hold Discipline trimmed** to a minimal safety net only:
  - If inputs are explicitly missing (e.g., user says they will upload a file/log), treat as PAUSE until provided.
  - No scaffolds, guesses, or fixes allowed while inputs are missing.
- Removed the verbose Evidence Hold wording that duplicated Baseline behaviour (now absorbed into Baseline v2.3.5 candidate).

## Rationale
- Baseline v2.3.4 + v2.3.5 candidate now carry the full Evidence Discipline (scoping pause, no scaffolds, refined "ask only when ambiguous").
- Loader only needs a lightweight safety net to prevent scaffolding when Baseline is absent (SAFE-REDUCED mode).
- This reduces duplication and avoids question-spam while retaining core safety.

## Compatibility
- Requires Baseline â‰¥ v2.3.3 (Answer, Pause, Evidence disciplines).
- Fully backward-compatible with v3.0.1-p1, but outputs simplified Evidence wording in loader section.
