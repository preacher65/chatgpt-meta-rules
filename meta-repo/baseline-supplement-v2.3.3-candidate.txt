# Baseline Supplement v2.3.3 (Candidate)

## Status
These items are **for further evaluation and discussion before implementation**. 
They are not part of the active baseline v2.3.2.

## Additions to Baseline Rules (Proposed)

### Snapshot Definition & Persistence
- Snapshot = the loaderâ€™s per-chat record of baseline version and advisory state, 
  derived only from visible project files.
- Snapshots reset on new conversations.
- Snapshots do not persist across chats unless pinned in account memory (ELB Reference) 
  or stored as project files.
- Branch chats inherit the parent snapshot; new chats start fresh.

### Imperative Discipline
- Read-only imperatives execute directly without confirmation:
  * status
  * show header
  * show mini
  * show precedence
- Heavy actions require explicit confirmation:
  * refresh baseline
  * set baseline
  * clear baseline

---

## Notes
- These refinements resolve two issues left open from friction-log-v2.3.0:
  * Hesitation on imperatives due to heavy action gating.
  * Ambiguity about snapshot persistence across sessions.
- All other items logged in v2.3.0 have been addressed in Baseline v2.3.1 and v2.3.2.
