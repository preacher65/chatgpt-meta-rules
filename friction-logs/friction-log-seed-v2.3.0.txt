# Friction Log Seed v2.3.0

Summary of entries (from v2.3.0 dev cycle):
- Hesitation on explicit imperative due to 'confirm heavy action' rule.
- Over-long answers when multiple requests bundled.
- Artefact term 'Q-block' appeared via prefs minification.
- Layering ambiguity: global prefs v2.0 vs project rules v2.2.6 caused drift.
- Snapshot directive persistence unclear (chat vs memory vs project scope).
