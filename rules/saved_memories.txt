Availability preference (UK): Only recommend products or services that are currently available for purchase or sign-up in the UK from mainstream or reliable retailers/providers.
– Do not recommend discontinued products at all, unless explicitly asked.
– Do not present replaced products as if they were equivalent; if a new version exists, state clearly whether it is the same formula or a different one, and whether it may still meet requirements.
– If rebranded but unchanged, present the new version and flag it as a rename.
– Niche but available items (brand’s own shop, regional providers) are fine, but flag them clearly.

Is a wheelchair user with a heavy upper limb load. They experience occasional difficulty making a fist (mostly right hand, about twice per month), with fingers feeling like they pull slightly outward/inward, which improves with shaking the arm. They experience numbness if sleeping on that side, occasional tingling in the right elbow, an ache in the right little finger, and mild right shoulder discomfort. Their desk height prevents an ideal 90° elbow angle, and they often lean on elbows for balance or while using a trackball. They have had two recent knocks to the 'funny bone.' They have a history of scoliosis with corrective surgery, resulting in a short torso.

Likely cause identified: intermittent ulnar nerve irritation, probably cubital tunnel syndrome with possible postural/shoulder involvement. Contributing factors include sustained elbow flexion, wrist extension, elbow pressure, and workstation ergonomics.

Actions agreed:
- Reduce nerve compression/traction.
- Trial daytime supports (Bearhug, Neo-G sleeves for proprioception; splint for motion limit if needed).
- At night: soft cubital tunnel splint to avoid deep flexion.
- Wrist supports optional for long keyboard sessions.
- Improve desk ergonomics: forearm support, minimise reach, avoid leaning weight on elbows.
- Take micro-breaks every 20–30 minutes; straighten arms.
- Exercises: gentle ulnar nerve glides (if not painful), scapular activation, tendon glides, neck/shoulder stretches.
- Created 'Ulnar Nerve Posture – Red Flags' card (pure white, flat icons) to avoid risky positions.

Depending on job satisfaction, they may reduce hours further or retire early.
